# Linters and Configs
Centralized storage for all lint, babel, sass, and the like config files.

> Note: Some of these like the .babel file are meant to be used with react, so if you're copying for something like a vanilla project it might not be for you.

#### .babelrc

TODO: notes

#### .eslint

TODO: notes

#### .prettierrc

Config file to overwrite defaults for [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). I think the default does a great job, the only rule I overwrite is prefferring single to double quotes.

#### .sass-lint.yml

TODO: notes

#### webpack.starter.js
